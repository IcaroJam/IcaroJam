Hi hi, Ari here!  
I'm currently getting my hands deep into the ✨wondrous world of coding✨ 42 style.  
ATM I can only really do stuff in C & C++, but I'm interested in webdev, python, games, robotics and a pretty long list of other cool things.
Not much to see on my profile right now, BUT, there will soon enough :)
