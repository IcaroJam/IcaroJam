- 👋 Hi there! I’m @TheNitromancer
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my general abilities as a programmer and having a broader look at the world of coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ on my own, with a (shamefully small) basis I obtained last year in university
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not much at the moment, wouldn't want to worsen a project by putting my questionable code into it.
- 📫 If you want to help me in my journey yo can review my code and suggest improvements in the [discussion](https://github.com/TheNitromancer/AoC/discussions) of my [Advent of Code](https://github.com/TheNitromancer/AoC) entry :)
