Hi hi, Ari here!  
I'm currently getting my hands deep into the ✨wondrous world of coding✨ 42 style.  
After doing lot's of stuff in good ol' C, I'm currently busy learning quantum computing with python, a bit of js and a bunch of other, maybe secret, perhaps ancient and obscure projects.  
I'm interested in webdev, python, gamedev, robotics and a pretty long list of other cool things.
